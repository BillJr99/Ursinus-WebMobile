excerpt: "Web and Mobile Development - RESTful Services"

info:
  goals: 
    - To explore Representational State Transfer (REST) service providers
    - To explain the mapping of RESTful verbs onto the HTTP verbs GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE
    - To explain how stateless HTTP calls can be used to establish state with a client

      title: JSON Objects
      questions:
        - "This JSON result was returned from a web request to <a href=\"https://api.weatherusa.net/v1/forecast?q=40.1915,-75.4559&daily=0&units=e&maxtime=7d\">https://api.weatherusa.net/v1/forecast?q=40.1915,-75.4559&daily=0&units=e&maxtime=7d</a>, which obtains the 7-day forecast at Ursinus College given the College's latitude and longitude GPS coordinates.  Use a <a href=\"https://jsonformatter.org/json-pretty-print\">JSON Pretty Printer</a> to better format the JSON for reading."
        - What do the curly braces represent?
        - What does the square bracket represent?
        - Modify the program to access this RESTful endpoint and, in a loop, print out each day's date (using <code>validt</code>) and temperature. An example <code>for</code> loop in <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_arrays.asp\">JavaScript</a> is given above.

      questions:
        - "Launch the given web service and invoke it using your choice of web client.  To do this, you will want to set up a <a href=\"http://mongodb.com\">mongodb</a> database, add a test user with a password, and allow access from any IP address.  MongoDB will give you a connection string that you can paste into <code>index.js</code> over my default <code>test_user</code> connection string.  <a href=\"https://dev.to/lennythedev/rest-api-with-mongodb-atlas-cloud-node-and-express-in-10-minutes-2ii1\">This article</a> details setting up a MongoDB account and data store.  In the code example, you can update your mongodb link, including your username and password, in the mongoose.connect line.  Be sure to remove these from your code when you're done, or better yet, de-activate that user account on mongodb (you can schedule this to expire when you create it)!"
        - "Invoke the service using a node.js application or a JavaScript browser client.  You can use the Advanced REST Client plugin for Chrome (or Postman, or a similar REST client plugin, on other browsers) or the <code>curl</code> command to execute your web service, in addition to the client code examples we saw previously.  Just update the link to your repl.it server project link in the commands or URL's shown here."
        - What HTTP verb is used to create a new item?  To retrieve an item?  To update an item?  To delete an item?
        - Why is POST used to create items while PUT is used to update them?  Aren't these interchangeable?
        - "What if you wanted to support other verbs on these items, like <code>putOnSale</code>?  Are service endpoints typically nouns or verbs, and how might you re-work a sale verb like this one into an appropriate CRUD endpoint?"
        - What is the advantage of separating your code into a model and a controller implementation?
