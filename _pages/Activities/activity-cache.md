      title: Checking Modification Date Using the HEAD verb
      questions:
        - How is this less expensive than making a full GET request, when we still need to do that anyway if the modification date from the HEAD response is newer than the version we have?
        - In addition to the response data (such as the web page), what other information would you need to store for the cache to be effective?
        - What kind of data structure would you use to save values into the cache?        
        - How often should you refresh the cache?

        Review <a href="https://medium.com/@danielsternlicht/caching-like-a-boss-in-nodejs-9bccbbc71b9b">this tutorial</a> that uses <code>node-cache</code> to return data from a cache lookup, calling a function to insert into the cache only if the data is out of date or nonexistent.

      questions:
        - "What data structure do you think underlies <code>node-cache</code>?"
