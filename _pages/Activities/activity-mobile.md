      title: An Example Client Application
      embed: <iframe height="800px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@BillJr99/Web-Game-Tutorial?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>  
      questions:
        - "Walk through each step of the sample application (from <a href=\"https://repl.it/@rafaelcastrocouto/Web-Game-Tutorial\">here</a>), and summarize each step's behavior in your own words.  Each group will report out on a different step of the process and demonstrate to the class."
        - If a mobile device is used to run this application, the right click does not work to allow movement.  What could we do about this?
