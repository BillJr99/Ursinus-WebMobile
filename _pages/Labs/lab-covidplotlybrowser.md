      beginning: The algorithm fails on the test inputs due to one or more minor issues
      progressing: The algorithm is implemented to solve the problem correctly according to given test inputs, but would fail if executed in a general case due to a minor issue or omission in the algorithm design or implementation
      proficient: A reasonable algorithm is implemented to solve the problem which correctly solves the problem according to the given test inputs, and would be reasonably expected to solve the problem in the general case

In this lab, you will use the [plot.ly](http://plot.ly) service to generate a graphical plot that will be fed back to your browser as an image, as if you had loaded it statically from a web server.  Specifically, we will download current COVID positivity data across the United States to generate the graph.

## Step 1: A plot.ly Tutorial
First, deploy [this tutorial](https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~PlotBot/880.js) in [repl.it](http://repl.it) to test out the plot.ly service.  You can save your file as a `html` webpage, uncomment the HTML code, and place the provided JavaScript where specified inside the `<script>` tag.  When you open the webpage, you should see a sample plot with two traces.  Inspect the JavaScript source code, specifically:

* What makes plot.ly generate a bar chart here?
* How did the plot "know" to render in the `plotly-div` HTML `div` element?
* Add a different animal to one or both of the traces, with a value of your choice.

## Step 2: Downloading COVID Data
In the `<script>` section, [make an HTTP GET request](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_http.asp) to the [COVID Tracking API](https://covidtracking.com/data/api).  For now, you can `console.log()` the text returned, so that it prints to the browser console window.  Specifically, you will use this endpoint: [https://api.covidtracking.com/v1/states/daily.json](https://api.covidtracking.com/v1/states/daily.json).  

Create two arrays for your plot: the `date` and the `positive` field (for the count of positive cases on that date).  For simplicity, only add those records whose `state` is a particular state, like PA.  You can obtain a JSON object (an array that you can iterate) as follows: `var responseObj = JSON.parse(xhttp.responseText);`.

Note that plot.ly expects dates to be in the form `yyyy-mm-dd`, while this data reports the date in `yyyymmdd` format.  Using the `str.substring` method, convert your date to the proper format.

## Step 3: Plotting COVID Data
Name your two arrays `xarr` and `yarr` for your dates and positive test counts, respectively.  You can use the following layout to plot your values in plot.ly.  Feel free to create your own layout; however, I have provided this one here so that you do not have to manually configure all the settings.

```javascript
trace = {
    uid: 'abc123',
    line: {
      color: 'rgb(255, 127, 14)', 
      shape: 'spline', 
      width: 3
    },  
    mode: 'lines', 
    name: "PA COVID Positives",
    type: 'scatter', 
    x: xarr,
    y: yarr
};

layout = {
  title: 'COVID Daily Positives', 
  width: 1000, 
  xaxis: {
    type: 'date', 
    title: 'Date', 
    range: [1583020800000, 1598918400000], // 3/1/2020 to 9/1/2020 in epoch milliseconds (https://www.epochconverter.com/)
    showgrid: false, 
    autorange: false, 
    tickformat: ''
  }, 
  yaxis: {
    type: 'linear', 
    title: 'Count', 
    autorange: false,
    range: [0, 300000],
    gridcolor: 'rgb(208, 208, 208)', 
    ticksuffix: '  '
  }, 
  height: 350, 
  legend: {
    x: -0.24796901053454015, 
    y: 0.9713068181818182, 
    bgcolor: 'rgba(242, 242, 242, 0)', 
    traceorder: 'reversed'
  }, 
  margin: {
    b: 20, 
    l: 175, 
    r: 80, 
    t: 20
  }, 
  autosize: false, 
  annotations: [
    {
      ax: -246, 
      ay: -164, 
      font: {
        size: 14, 
        color: 'rgb(129, 129, 126)'
      }, 
      text: 'Count', 
      arrowcolor: 'rgba(68, 68, 68, 0)'
    }
  ], 
  plot_bgcolor: 'rgb(242, 242, 242)', 
  paper_bgcolor: 'rgb(242, 242, 242)'            
};

data = [trace];

Plotly.plot('plotly-div', {
  data: data,
  layout: layout
}); 
```

## Step 4: Choropleth Graph
Finally, create a [Choropleth Graph](https://plotly.com/javascript/choropleth-maps/#usa-choropleth-map) that shades the states according to their most recent total case counts.  Notice that the example loads a [csv file of data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/2011_us_ag_exports.csv); however, you can continue to generate the data arrays as you have done before.  `locations` is an array of two-letter state codes, and `z` is a parallel array of the value you're plotting.  

## Step 5: Choropleth Graph using CSV Data

In the previous step, you may have noticed that the example code can load a CSV file directly.  Modify that initial example to load [this CSV](https://api.covidtracking.com/v1/states/current.csv) to plot total cases by state.

## Extra Credit (10%): Modify Step 3 for All States
Create a dictionary of `xarr` and `yarr` arrays, with the state as the key.  Notice that the `data` variable in Step 3 is actually an array of `trace`s.  Append all count data to that appropriate state key array, and then create an array of `trace` dictionaries, which you will `push` to the `data` array.  You can comment out the `data = [trace];` line in Step 3, since you'll be creating it yourself.  Now, you'll have every state plotted together!

```javascript
var dict = {};
dict['key'] = 'value';
dict['arr'] = [];         // you can append to this
dict['arr'].push(5);      // like any other array!
dict['key']['arr1'] = []; // here is another one
dict['key']['arr2'] = []; // and another one

for(var key in dict) { // you can iterate the dict!
    console.log(key + ": " + dict[key]);
}
```
