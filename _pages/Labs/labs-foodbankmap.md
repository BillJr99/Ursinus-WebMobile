In this lab, you will design a RESTful service interface that represents food bank locations, and implement it using node.js and a browser frontend that uses the Google Maps API \[[^1]\].  Users should be able to POST food bank locations, and the browser script should place markers on the map along with the user's current location.

## Part 1: Service Backend and Testing
Design a RESTful web service in node.js that stores the name and address of food banks.  In addition to storing the name and address, you should store the latitude and longitude of the location when you create or update a resource.  You can lookup the latitude and longitude for the address by calling [this API from ArcGIS](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/rest/search-for-an-address/).

You should support:

* GET: Retrieve a list of all food banks
* POST: Create a food bank given its name and address
* PUT: Update a food bank given its ID, its new name and/or new address
* DELETE: Delete a food bank given its ID

Test each of these using a client program, a web browser, or a cURL command, and show the results of your testing.

## Part 2: Google Map Frontend Configuration and Tutorial
The example below shows a minimal working example of a Google Map that plots the location of Ursinus College, and plots a custom marker with a location given by the current location as obtained through the browser client.

<iframe height="400px" width="100%" src="https://repl.it/@BillJr99/GoogleMapExample?lite=true" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-forms allow-pointer-lock allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-modals"></iframe>

### Elements of the Working Example

#### Adding an Element to Hold the Map
First, set up a web page with a `div` element to hold the map.  We'll call it `map`.

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<div id="map"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

Between the `html` and `body` opening tags, we can add CSS styling inline to set the size of the map:

```javascript
  <html>
  <head>
    <style>
       /* Set the size of the div element that contains the map */
      #map {
        height: 400px;  /* The height is 400 pixels */
        width: 100%;  /* The width is the width of the web page */
       }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
  ...
  </body>
```

Inside the `<body>`, let's call the Google Maps API script to render the map.  We'll provide a `callback` parameter which will invoke a script that we'll write in our page.  We'll call this function `initMap`.  You'll also need an API Key, which we'll discuss shortly.

```javascript
    <body>
    ...
    <script defer
    src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE&callback=initMap">
    </script>
    ...
    </body>
```

To implement the `initMap` function, add a `<script>` tag inside your `<body>` tag.  Our function creates a marker at a given latitude and longitude, and plots it on the map.

Note that the `map` variable is declared without a `var` tag.  This places the variable into the global scope, so that we can access it from other script functions later.

```javascript
    <body>
    <script>
    function initMap() {
      // The location of Ursinus College
      var ursinus = {lat: 40.1915, lng: -75.4559};
      // The map, centered at Ursinus
      map = new google.maps.Map(
          document.getElementById('map'), {zoom: 4, center: ursinus}); // no var == global scope
      // The marker, positioned at Ursinus College
      var marker = new google.maps.Marker({position: ursinus, map: map});
    }    
    </script>
    ...
    </body>
```

At the end of the `initMap()` function, you can call `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(showPosition)`, which will callback another function that you'll write shortly, and that we'll call `showPosition`.  This gets the current latitude and longitude of the user, if they grant that permission to the browser.  For clarity, we'll place this geolocation call in another function called `getLocation` and call it from `initMap`.

```javascript
    function getLocation() {
      // https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_geolocation.asp 
      if (navigator.geolocation) {
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(showPosition); // callback
      } else {
        //Geolocation is not supported by this browser
      }
    }
    
    function initMap() {
        ...
        getLocation();
    }
```

Finally, let's implement the `showPosition` function, which takes a single parameter representing the user's location.  We'll create a second marker and place it on the map representing the user's current location.  This function goes with the other scripts on the page.

```javascript
    function showPosition(position) {
      // display your position using a beach flag icon
      // https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/markers
      var image = {
        url: 'https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/full/images/beachflag.png',
        // This marker is 20 pixels wide by 32 pixels high.
        size: new google.maps.Size(20, 32),
        // The origin for this image is (0, 0).
        origin: new google.maps.Point(0, 0),
        // The anchor for this image is the base of the flagpole at (0, 32).
        anchor: new google.maps.Point(0, 32)
      };

      var currentPosition = {lat: position.coords.latitude, lng: position.coords.longitude};
      var currentLocationMarker = new google.maps.Marker({position: currentPosition, icon: image, map: map});
    }
```

### Setting up a Google Maps API Key

To obtain a Google API key on your account, first go to [https://console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com), and log into your Google account.  Select "Credentials" under the "APIs and Services" menu on the left.

![Google API Key](../images/lab-foodbankmap/googleapiappkey.png)

Select your project from the top (or create a new one if prompted), and click the "Create Credentials" button near the top middle of the page.  Select "API key" to create a new key.

![Google API Credentials](../images/lab-foodbankmap/googlemapcreatecredentials.png)

Fill out the form that appears and you will be given an API key.  Copy this down: it will go into your webpage above at the placeholder `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`.

Next, click the "Library" menu on the left, and search for the "Maps JavaScript API" service.  Click on it.

![Google API Library of Services](../images/lab-foodbankmap/googleapilibrary.png)

Click "Enable" to add it to your project and key.

![Enabling Maps Service](../images/lab-foodbankmap/googleapienablemaps.png)

Under the Credentials menu on the left, click the "Edit" icon on your key to manage it.  We're going to add "restrictions" to your key so that others cannot use it.  This is especially important if you have enabled billing on your key (which we will not!).

![Managing the Key](../images/lab-foodbankmap/googleapimanagekey.png)

I added an HTTP referrer restriction as shown below.  Specifically, I added my repl.it URL (seen on the repl.it browser page on the right side of your repl.it project), with a `/*` at the end, to show that all URL's under this domain are acceptable.  I added a second variant of the URL for external browser access, which you can see and replicate below.  Now, I can only use this key from my repl.it project web page.

Additionally, I added an API restriction and selected "Google Maps API" so that the key can only be used for calls to the Google Maps API, and not to other Google services.

![Adding Key Restrictions](../images/lab-foodbankmap/googleapirestrictkey.png)

Try it out by copying the repl.it URL into a web browser and allowing location access.  You will get an error that says the map failed to load, and it will display "For development purposes only" as an overlay on the map, if you do not have billing set up for the Google API service.  This is perfectly acceptable, and there is no need to set up any billing accounts!

## Part 3: Plotting Locations
Iterate over the food bank latitude and longitude values obtained by issuing a GET request on your web service, and plot them on the map, using the example provided.

## Part 4: Identifying the Closest Food Bank
Using the [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula) to compute the distance between two points on a sphere, approximate the distance between your current location and each food bank.  You may use [this example](https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html) to compute the distance.  Choose a custom marker image for the nearest one and add it to the map.
 
 Finally, add a `div` tag to the webpage, and set its `innerHTML` value to the name, address, and computed distance of that food bank, so that they appear on the browser page.
