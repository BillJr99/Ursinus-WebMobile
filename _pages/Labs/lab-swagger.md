In this lab, you will document a web service using [Swagger](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/2-0/basic-structure/).

You can add a Swagger renderer to your web service via:

```javascript
const swaggerUi = require("swagger-ui-express");
```

You can then document your data schema using a JSON structure:

```javascript
const swaggerDocument = <JSON HERE>
```

You can get an example JSON structure by going [here](https://editor.swagger.io/), and exporting the structure that you find to a JSON file (under the `File` menu at the website).

You can instantiate a path to your Swagger document as follows, which you can access at your usual URL with `/api/doc` appended to the end (as configured below):

```javascript
app.use('/api/doc', swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(swaggerDocument));
```

You can even document your authentication paths, such as OAuth!  [See here for additional description of documentation structures supported by Swagger.](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/the-simplest-way-to-add-swagger-to-a-node-js-project-c2a4aa895a3c)

Note that you will need to enable CORS to try out the endpoints!

Here is a minimal working example:

## Part 1: Adding Swagger Documentation

Add Swagger documentation to one of your assignments or labs, and take a screenshot of the `/api/doc` page that is served when you run the project.
