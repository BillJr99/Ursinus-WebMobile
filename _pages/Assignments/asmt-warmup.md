The purpose of this assignment is to get us setup for the course, both by getting to know each other better, and by setting up the software environment.

## Personal Survey (10 Pts)

I gave a couple of fun facts about myself in the class, but I want to get to know you all better. So please submit answers to the following questions as a private message to me on [{{ page.info.chatname }}]({{ page.info.chatlink }}).

1.  Your Name, Your Nickname (if applicable) / Preferred Pronouns
2.  What is your reason for taking the course? (Blunt honesty is perfectly fine here, if applicable)
3.  What are you majoring in / interested in majoring in?
4.  What do you think you might want to do after Ursinus?
5.  Have you had any experience with computer science / programming? (It's okay if you haven't!)
6.  What are you most excited about in this course?
7.  What are you the most worried about in this course?
8.  A fun fact about yourself
9.  Anything else you think I should know?
10.  Please attach **a headshot** picture to your message. I will use this to help get to know your name, but we will also use this in class to arrange groups.
11. Please post a short introduction and a hello to the class on the Canvas Introductions discussion forum.  There is also a Water Cooler discussion group that you can use for social discussions as well!
12.  Finally, we will be sharing work with each other through electronic means.  To protect your privacy, you are welcome to use a pseudonym on your work in lieu of your name.  Let me know if you'd like to use a pseudonym on your assignments, and what name you'll use.

## Web Poll for Office Hours

You will not be graded on this, but I want to setup my office hours so that everyone can make at least one of them. Please [click here]({{ page.info.officehourspoll }}) and select every block in which you can attend at least 30 minutes in your schedule. You may use a pseudonym or post anonymously if you wish.

### Class Notebook

We will use an electronic shared notebook throughout the class.  You'll be able to take notes there, see the whiteboard notes that I create, and respond to some reflective journal prompts throughout the course.  We'll use [{{page.info.class_notebook_name}}]({{ page.info.class_notebook }}), which you can access through this link.

### VPN

You can access the Ursinus network remotely by using a Virtual Private Network (VPN).  This is a protocol and software package that connect your computer to the Ursinus network using your login and password, allowing you to access computers and resources (like library resources) that would normally require you to be physically located on the campus network.  Please follow [these](https://www.ursinus.edu/offices/information-technology/technology-support/hardware-and-software-help/remote-connections-and-vpn/) instructions to connect to the VPN.  When submitting class exercises, you will connect to the VPN so that we can authenticate and determine which student is completing which exercise.

## Syllabus (5pts)

Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with [the course syllabus]({{ site.baseurl }}). Then, **please send me a second message on [{{ page.info.chatname }}]({{ page.info.chatlink }}) with the answers to the following questions**

1.  True/False: If you choose to work with a buddy, you are allowed to look at your buddy's code and show them your code during labs
2.  True/False: If you choose to work with a buddy, you are allowed to look at your buddy's code and show them your code for regular assignments.
3.  True/False: You may look at any classmate's code during a regular assignment.
4.  What happens if you show up after the lecture has already started?
5.  Where is the help room located?
<!--6.  Extra credit (+2) Send me a selfie of yourself inside of the help room.-->
