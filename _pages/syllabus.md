  course_description: "This course explores web service architectures through the lens of ubiquitous computing sensors and mobile devices.  Authentication models such as SAML and OAUTH will be used to integrate well-known web service interfaces.  Students will be able to expose services as well-defined GraphQL or RESTful service endpoints, and be able to utilize the endpoints of existing services.  Students will collaboratively propose, develop, and present projects with defined broader impacts."
  welcome_message: "Welcome to CS471!  In this course, we will explore the ubiquitous nature of web services for communications and data exchange, and techniques to harnass this ubiquitous data source to improve the world around us."

  flexible_submission_policy: "In the absence of <a href=\"#accommodations\">accommodations</a> arranged in advance with the instructor or college, all assignments are due at 11:59PM Eastern Time on the date(s) stated on the schedule.  No prior permission is required for flexible submission, which allows up to 2 days to be used during the semester by each student.  For example, one deliverable may be submitted 2 days late, or two deliverables may each be submitted 1 day late.  After these 2 days are utilized, subsequent deliverables may be submitted after the deadline, awarding up to: 95% credit for work submitted up to 6 hours past the deadline, 90% credit for work submitted up to 24 hours past the deadline, 80% credit for work submitted up to 48 hours past the deadline, and 50% credit for work submitted up to 7 days past the deadline.  To exercise flexible submission, please e-mail the instructor after submitting your deliverable, indicating: a) which deliverable you have submitted past the deadline, and b) how many flex days you wish to use (if any)."
