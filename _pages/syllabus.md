  course_description: "This course explores web service architectures through the lens of ubiquitous computing sensors and mobile devices.  Authentication models such as SAML and OAUTH will be used to integrate well-known web service interfaces.  Students will be able to expose services as well-defined GraphQL or RESTful service endpoints, and be able to utilize the endpoints of existing services.  Students will collaboratively propose, develop, and present projects with defined broader impacts."

  flexible_submission_policy: "In the absence of <a href=\"#accommodations\">accommodations</a> arranged in advance with the instructor or college, all assignments are due at 11:59PM Eastern Time on the date(s) stated on the schedule.  No prior permission is required for flexible submission, which allows up to 2 days to be used during the semester by each student.  For example, one deliverable may be submitted 2 days late, or two deliverables may each be submitted 1 day late.  After these 2 days are utilized, subsequent deliverables may be submitted after the deadline, awarding up to: 95% credit for work submitted up to 6 hours past the deadline, 90% credit for work submitted up to 24 hours past the deadline, 80% credit for work submitted up to 48 hours past the deadline, and 50% credit for work submitted up to 7 days past the deadline.  To exercise flexible submission, please e-mail the instructor after submitting your deliverable, indicating: a) which deliverable you have submitted past the deadline, and b) how many flex days you wish to use (if any)."
